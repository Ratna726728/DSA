INTRODUCTION TO DSA:


# DSA:

The term DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms, in the context of computer science.

## where, Data Structure consists of-

- Linked list
- Matrix /Grid
- Queue 
- Stack
- Array
- Hash 
- Heap
- Graph
- String 
- Tree


## And Algorithm is consists of:

- Pattern searching
- Divide & conquer
- Searching
- Sorting 
- Bitwise
- Greedy
- Recursion
- Backtracking
- Mathematical
- Dyanamic Programming

# What is DSA?

- Data Structure and Algorithms (DSA) refers to the study of methods for organizing and storing data and the design procedures (algorithms) 
for solving problems, which operate on these data structures.

#Best way to learn DSA?

- The best way is to divide DSA into parts and learn it.

- We divide DSA in 5 parts:

1. Learn at least one programming language.

2. Learn about Time complexity and space complexity.

3. Learn Data Structures.

4. Learn Algorithms.

5. Practice problems and compete in compitions and do more practice.


# DATA STRUCTURE:

- Data Strucuture are essential components that help organize and store data efficiently in computer memory.

- They provide a way to manage and manipulate data effectively, enabling faster access, insertion, and deletion operation.

- common data structures include arrays, linked list, stacks, queues, tree, and graphs, each serving specific purpose based on the requirements of the problem at hand.

# ALGORITHMS:


- Algorithms are well defined sets of instructions designed that are used to solve problems or perform a task.

- To put in simpler terms, it is a set of operations performed in a step-by-step manner to execute a task.

- It is essential to have an algorithm that is both tme ans space-advanced and the best way to illuminate various kinds of issues is with the help of various kinds of algorithmic techniques.

- Algorithm in programming are used to get the desired result, these algorithms are language-indepedent, that is, they can be invoked in any language.
As expected the output will also be the same.
